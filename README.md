## **AI and Data Science**

As a dedicated data scientst, I specialize in extracting actionable insights from raw data using Python. Here's how I leverage this versatile language:

1. **Data Wrangling with pandas**:
   - **Pandas** I use it to clean and transform messy datasets, merge tables, and perform aggregations.

2. **Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn**:
   - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** I create line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps that convey complex information concisely.

3. **Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Leveraging **SciPy** and **StatsModels**, I conduct rigorous statistical analyses. Whether it's t-tests, ANOVA, or regression, Python provides the foundation for robust decision-making.

4. **Machine Learning Endeavors**:
   - With **Scikit-learn**, I build predictive modelsâ€”linear regression, decision trees, and clustering. Feature engineering and cross-validation are integral parts of my toolkit.

5. **Jupyter Notebooks as My Canvas**:
   - **Jupyter notebooks** is used to document code, visualizations, and insights, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
